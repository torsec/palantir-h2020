	Talaia Networks is a highly innovative company based in Barcelona, Spain.
	Behind the products of Talaia Networks lies the expertise of more than 20
	years of research in network security and monitoring from its founders at
	UPC-BarcelonaTech. Talaia Networks aims to stay at the cutting edge of the
	state-of-the art in network management and security.

<p class="text-justify">
	Talaia, the flagship product of Talaia Networks, is a network visibility
	and security system commercialized under the Software-as-a-Service model,
	that by combining machine learning and data analytics algorithms, obtains
	a superior security-to-cost ratio as compared to competing solutions. The
	interests of Talaia Networks lie in technologies for network security, key
	performance metric measurement, traffic classification, and on-the-fly
	streaming data analysis, enriched with intelligent machine learning
	algorithms, in both traditional and software-defined networks.

	Nowadays, Talaia has presence in almost all continents. Customers from
	Talaia cover many different market segments and purposes. For example,
	Digital Ocean, the second largest web hosting cloud provider in the world,
	uses Talaia to easily monitor their networks and rapidly react to network
	attacks, while Transtelco, an Internet Service Provider present in Mexico
	and USA, not only uses Talaia to monitor its network, but also to resell
	our security service to their customers.
