<!-- <h1 class="titlecustom">Mission</h1> -->

<p class="text-justify pcustom">During the past years, society has witnessed cyber-attacks being deployed with increasing frequency and impact, reaching even a global scale. Modern organisations have been quick to adopt new technologies such as Threat Intelligence services, Artificial Intelligence etc. to secure their digital infrastructures. The fact remains, however, that Small-Medium Enterprises and Microenterprises have limited access to such novel cyber defence measures.</p>

<p class="text-justify pcustom">PALANTIR project focuses and improves upon novel technologies like SDN/NFV, Machine Learning, Trust and Attestation etc. These are starting to be widely adopted by large organisations but are usually not affordable by SMEs/MEs. In order to make these technologies affordable in a sustainable way, PALANTIR looks at the research gaps that need to be addressed to improve service performance and cut costs across all the relevant stakeholders in the value chain: (a)The combination of risk analysis with cost/benefit analysis and their connection to the Service Catalogue with multiple choices w.r.t to products and delivery modes; (b) the implementation of a novel Threat Intelligence framework and SecaaS ecosystem with hybrid detection capabilities, (c) the creation of  Security Orchestration on top of traditional service orchestration and management, (d) the live intelligence sharing with high-level policy sharing in a fully anonymised way. These will be showcased in all PALANTIR Use Cases.</p>

<p class="text-justify pcustom">PALANTIR envisions a value chain among its stakeholders, in order to create a sustainable ecosystem of services. Stakeholders in the cybersecurity, analytics, artificial intelligence etc. areas undertake the role of Service Developer and monetise their products through the Service Catalogue. Communication Service Providers (CSPs, such as telcos, internet service providers, cloud providers, platform manufacturers), cybersecurity companies etc. can undertake the role of PALANTIR providers and deploy the entire platform in their infrastructure. SecaaS clients SMEs/MEs purchase services from the PALANTIR providers. Finally, the GDPR data subjects are natural persons that are protected by the PALANTIR SecaaS.</p>
