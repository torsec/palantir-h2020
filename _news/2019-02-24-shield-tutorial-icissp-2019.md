The SHIELD consortium has organised a tutorial within the 5th *International
Conference on Information Systems Security and Privacy* (**ICISSP 2019**),
entitled **Modern Network-based
Security: Softwarized Networking, Trusted Computing, and Artificial
Intelligence for Cybersecurity** on February 24, 2019.

This tutorial will briefly introduce modern network technologies (SDN,
Software Defined Networking, and NFV, Network Function Virtualization) and
then show how to use them along with *Trusted Computing* (TC),
*Machine Learning* (ML), and *Artificial Intelligence* (AI) techniques to create a
trusted protection infrastructure to effectively counter cyberattacks.
The technical aspects will be complemented by a market and economical
analysis, to evaluate benefits versus costs.
