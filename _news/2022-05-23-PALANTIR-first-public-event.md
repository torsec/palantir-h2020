PALANTIR aims at bridging the gap between large enterprises and SMEs/MEs, by providing multi-layered, infrastructure-wide threat monitoring, cyber-resiliency and knowledge sharing in a heterogeneous ecosystem, while at the same time being able to market these services to third parties in the form of Security-as-a-service (SECaaS).

In this first PALANTIR demo event, the goals and achievements so far will be presented.

Three storylines that demonstrate core PALANTIR capabilities are demonstrated:

<ul>
<li>Botnet Detection and Active Response on SME/ME networks</li>
<li>Data Breach Detection and Recovery via AI-based Log Analysis</li>
<li>Lifecycle Management and Remote Attestation of PALANTIR Security Capabilities</li>
</ul>
