Telef&oacute;nica I+D has presented the SHIELD project results and run a real 
exercise based on an enterprise use case to demonstrate the performance and
functionality with real traffic collected from other partners in the
consortium.

The workshop was attended by personnel coming from different departments and
business units in Telef&oacute;nica, including technical and operational
staff. Valuable feedback and recommendations were provided, including initial
conversation about commercial models, network integration and standardization
needs.

The workshop included a general description of the project SHIELD, a
presentation of the main components of its architecture, the standardization
activities in progress and a demonstration of the platform. The main
exercise focused on how a worm attack can be detected and mitigated based on
Artificial Intelligence thanks to the SHIELD Data Analysis and
Remediation Engine in a real environment.
Finally, the integrity verification capability of the SHIELD project - based
on the Trust Monitor module - was demonstrated to the audience.
