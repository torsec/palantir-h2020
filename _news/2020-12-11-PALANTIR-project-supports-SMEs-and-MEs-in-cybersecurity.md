September 1st, 2020 marked the official start of PALANTIR, a cybersecurity focused project funded by the H2020 Programme.

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and Microenterprises (MEs) often have no systematic approach for ensuring digital security and 60% of them are not able to recover economically from a cyberattack. PALANTIR aims at bridging the gap between large enterprises and SMEs/MEs.

PALANTIR seeks to provide a practical framework that will allow organizations to assess and manage cybersecurity risks while offering hybrid incident detection with live threat intelligence sharing enabling the detection of unprecedented complex threats for Security-as-a-Service (SECaaS) clients. Clients will be able to define their cybersecurity needs and benefit from affordable Managed Security Services (MSS) through a vendor-agnostic Service Catalogue. The democratization of cybersecurity along with the deployment of technologies such as Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN) will reduce costs for all involved stakeholders, safeguarding the financial sustainability of PALANTIR’s proposed solution disrupting, at the same time, the economic benefits of the attacker.

Being in its early stages, the consortium brings together 15 organizations - research institutes, universities, industries and SMEs - that share a common vision in cybersecurity.

The consortium partners  coming from all across Europe, are the following: DBC Europe S.A.- coordinator (Belgium), INFILI Technologies Private Company (Greece), Fundació Privada i2CAT, Internet i Innovació digital a Catalunya (Spain), Universidad de Murcia (Spain), Space Hellas S.A. (Greece), Hewlett-Packard Limited (United Kingdom), NEC Laboratories Europe GmbH (Germany), Telefonica I+D (Spain), Politecnico di Torino (Italy), INCITES Consulting S.A. (Luxembourg), National Centre for Scientific Research Demokritos (Greece), Orion Innovations P.C. (Greece), UBITECH Limited (Cyprus), SFERA IT d.o.o. (Slovenia), Stratiotiki Sxoli Evelpidon (Greece).

The research activities within PALANTIR benefit society as a whole and not specific groups disproportionately. The ultimate goal of the PALANTIR framework is to transform the SMEs, MEs and also citizens (as users and consumers of services) from passive viewers to active players, without having to sacrifice extravagant resources for infrastructure and personnel training. To this end, PALANTIR can be used not only as an affordable SecaaS cybersecurity platform, but also as a means of strengthening cybersecurity awareness of growing threats from the synergetic collaboration between organisations, network service providers and infrastructure providers.
