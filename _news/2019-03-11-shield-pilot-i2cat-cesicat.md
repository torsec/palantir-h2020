The cybersecurity agency pilot of SHIELD has been carried out on 11 March
2019 by the i2CAT Foundation for
[CESICAT](https://ciberseguretat.gencat.cat/ca/inici),
the centre for Cybersecurity of the Catalan Government, in charge of the
private network and applications of the Government. Several feedback was
produced during the presentations, the piloting and the discussion. Firstly,
CESICAT thinks that the trusted computing of SHIELD is quite impressive and
that it would be a great addition to consider also the 0-trusted concept in
the solution. Secondly, they pointed on the importance to create operator
specific use-cases to show all the potential of SHIELD. Moreover, it would be
important to define SHIELD as an automatization solution for automatization
engineers. Finally, regarding the dashboard for CERTS, they pointed out the
importance of having some risk analysis metrics that would be very useful for
security managers (which are actually risk managers).
